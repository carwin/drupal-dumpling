# Drupal Dumpling

Drush does a great job of making the creation of database backups easy, what it doesn't do is recursively search a directory for any Drupal site and create a sqldump to a specified directory.

Drupal Dumpling does.

## Usage
* Currently, you need to modify the script and change the directories to suit your needs. Some day this will be better.
* `./drupal-dumpling.rb`

You can also run this on cron for scheduled backups of all your Drupal sites.
